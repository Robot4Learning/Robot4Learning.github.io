We all learn about different things, at our own pace and method. In classical education, a class of learners is meant to learn a standard course in a pace consistent for the entire class. However, when a group of students are taught the same lessons at the same pace some students may lag in comprehension while some others excel. The concept of adaptive learning originates from the fact that every learner has a unique learning curve and personalized content aligned to her learning curve can improve learning outcomes. Recent technologies have made it possible to capture learner’s data, on the basis of which the system delivers different topics to the learner.\nThe Robots for Learning workshop, in its 5th series, focuses on adaptive learning. Adaptive learning systems are envisioned to maximize learning efficiency, improve learning outcomes, create personalised learning experience, generate analytics for early interventions, increase engagement, and allow for customizability to fit individual needs and preferences. In this workshop, we aim to discuss the approaches and challenges of using robots for learner-centric methods, learning path adaptation, social personalisation, remediation and multimodal techniques. Robots can be able to perceive and monitor learning, and at the same time empathize and give personalized feedback to the learners.\nWith this workshop, we aim at discussing recent advances in empirical and theoretical state-of-the-art research contributions on HRI in educational contexts regarding the following challenges: how adaptivity can play a role in the educational context? How can we use machine learning to provide better learning? How could robots be used to foster adaptive learning for a group of users?\nList of topics  Adaptive mechanisms for robot tutors, personalization and adaptation algorithms for tutoring interactions Design of autonomous systems for tutoring interactions Theories and methods for tutoring (pedagogical and language acquisition) Shared knowledge and knowledge modelling in HRI Human-robot collaborative learning Attachment and learning with a social robot (social and cognitive development) Engagement in educational human-robot interaction Human-robot relationship assessment Designing student models and assessing student’s learning Playful learning with a robot Human-robot creativity Kinesthetic and non-verbal communication in human-robot interaction Impact of embodiment on learning Technical innovation in learning or teaching robots Long term learning interactions, design and methodologies for repeated human-robot encounters Robots for learners with special needs and special abilities Education and re-training for adults Rehabilitation and re-education Privacy and ethical issues in robot tutoring applications  Program 9:00-9:05 Introduction 9:05-9:40 Keynote Tony Belpaeme (30 min +5) 9:40-10:30 Presentations (2 papers, 20 min +5 each) 10:30-11:00 Coffee break 11:00-11:50 Presentations (2 papers, 20 min +5 each) 11:50-12:50 Semi-structured group discussions 12:50-13:00 Conclusion \u0026amp; Wrap up\nSelected Papers    Children’s anthropomorphism of second language robot tutors (Mirjam de Haas, Rianne van den Berghe, Paul Leseman, Emiel Krahmer, Josje Verhagen, Paul Vogt, Bram Willemsen and Jan de Wit)     Storytelling with a social robot (Nicole Goossens, Rian Aarts and Paul Vogt)     Effective robot-human skill transfer via mutual reinforcement learning (Sayanti Roy, Emily Kieson, Charles Abramson and Christopher Crick)   ","date":1571011200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571011200,"objectID":"e90afb9ab78b02d291551e45c71df8d1","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/event/roman2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/roman2019/","section":"event","summary":"Building Interactions for Classroom Robots","tags":["r4l","roman2019","roman"],"title":"R4L @RoMan 2019","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview Since several years, several research groups have investigated the use of robots for learning and teaching. Their work is divided into two main streams that we could call the interaction stream (i-stream) and the building stream (b-stream).The I-stream develops embodied agents able to conduct rich interactions with learners. These are mainly humanoids, part of humanoids or robotised animals that engaged learners in activities (writing, playing, counting, …) and are able to interact about these activities. These robots namely provide verbal and non-verbal hints, encouragement and feedback on several dimensions of the task: performance, cognitive (e.g. level of (mis-)understanding), social (e.g. regulation turn taking in teams), meta-cognitive or emotional. In the b-stream, the learner’s activities is to build the robots capacities. The most popular building activities consist of programming a robot such Thymio, mostly to acquire programming skills. Many other projects in the Makers or FabLab educational initiatives explore the physical construction of the robot either by assembling components from a toolkit such as Lego Mindstorms or by using 3D printing, wiring, etc. These construction activities usually include programming is well, but generally target broader learning goals, mostly STEM skills.\nWhile the I-STREAM addresses research questions that are very close to HRI and ROMAN topics, the work on the b-stream is generally addressed in other venues, creating a divide within those who explore robots in education. This workshop proposes to bring these two streams together because many developments that exist in one stream could also benefit to the other stream. A typical example of these synergies are situations where a humanoid (i-stream) and a learner jointly manipulate a graspable robot (b-stream). This workshop aims to create many more bridges between these two streams.\nList of topics  Learning activities in HRI Adaptive mechanisms for robot tutors Engagement in educational human-robot interaction Gain in learning vs fun in learning with a robot Observational and Kinesthetic learning in human-robot interaction Attachment and learning with a social robot Impact of embodiment on learning Shared knowledge and knowledge modelling in HRI Technical innovation in learning or teaching robots The role of teachers in child-robot interactions Rehabilitation and re-education Human-robot collaborative learning Human-robot creativity Human-robot knowledge sharing Multi-party interaction and group interaction Mixed human, robot and virtual teams  Program 14:00-14:20 Welcome and Introduction\n14:20-14:45 Social Robot as an Awareness Tool to Help Regulate Collaboration in a Project Meeting.

While robots have been popular as a focus for STEM teaching (see Lego Mindstorms or Thymio), the use of robots as tutors is novel. The field of HRI has started reporting on how to make effective robot tutors and how to measure their efficacy. These studies have shown that the potential of robots in educational settings is inarguable: robot can provide educational content tailored to the individual, something which is missing from current educational settings. They also have the potential to enhance learning via kinesthetic interaction, can improve the learner’s self-esteem and can provide empathic feedback. Finally, robots have been shown to engage the learner, to motivate her in the learning task or to enhance collaboration in a group. However, many questions still remain. For instance, what interaction strategies aid learning, and which hamper learning? How can we deal with the current technical limitations of robots? How should effective lessons be developed and implemented on a robot? Answering these and other questions requires a multidisciplinary effort, including contributions from pedagogy, developmental psychology, (computational) linguistics, artificial intelligence and HRI, among others. The aim of this workshop is to engage scholars who aim to gain expertise in education and in robotics (from instructional design to inverse kinematics, ROS to ZPD, Markov to Piaget) into a new interdisciplinary community working on educational robotics. Participants will benefit from hearing from the forefront of field and from discussions on how to move from fundamental research towards the development of market-ready educational robots.\nList of topics  Adaptive mechanisms for robot tutors, personalization and adaptation algorithms for tutoring interactions Theories and methods for tutoring (pedagogical and language acquisition) Engagement in educational human-robot interaction Gain in learning vs fun in learning with a robot Kinesthetic and non-verbal communication in human-robot interaction Attachment and learning with a social robot (social and cognitive development) Impact of embodiment on learning Shared knowledge and knowledge modelling in HRI Technical innovation in learning or teaching robots Rehabilitation and reeducation Long term learning interactions, design and methodologies for repeated human-robot encounters Human-robot collaborative learning Human-robot creativity Design of autonomous systems for tutoring interactions Privacy and ethical issues in robot tutoring applications  Invited Speakers  Pierre Dillenbourg, EPFL, Switzerland  Selected Papers Uncanny Valley Feeling an Impact on Learning: A preliminary Experiment performed in a French Elementary School.

The authors have been implementing two approaches to designing robot/child interaction activities for ESL children : one-on-one learning in play and small-group learning in play. In the former approach, a child interacted with an embodied robot individually to develop vocabulary and early literacy skills. Based on our study of theories of learning and child development, we sought to create engaging robot-based learning, where the child played with the robot to practice the skills. Through our experience, it was clear that pedagogically solid design and iterative refinement led to sustainable robot/child interaction. The latter approach is currently being explored in our on-going research. Acknowledging that language learning and cultural understanding are inseparable, we examine the role of a robot as a cultural broker that mediates collaborative learning and play among children from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds.

We all learn about different things, at our own pace and method. In classical education, a class of learners is meant to learn a standard course in a pace consistent for the entire class. However, when a group of students are taught the same lessons at the same pace some students may lag in comprehension while some others excel. The concept of adaptive learning originates from the fact that every learner has a unique learning curve and personalized content aligned to her learning curve can improve learning outcomes. Recent technologies have made it possible to capture learner’s data, on the basis of which the system delivers different topics to the learner.\nThe Robots for Learning workshop, in its 5th series, focuses on adaptive learning. Adaptive learning systems are envisioned to maximize learning efficiency, improve learning outcomes, create personalised learning experience, generate analytics for early interventions, increase engagement, and allow for customizability to fit individual needs and preferences. In this workshop, we aim to discuss the approaches and challenges of using robots for learner-centric methods, learning path adaptation, social personalisation, remediation and multimodal techniques. Robots can be able to perceive and monitor learning, and at the same time empathize and give personalized feedback to the learners.\nWith this workshop, we aim at discussing recent advances in empirical and theoretical state-of-the-art research contributions on HRI in educational contexts regarding the following challenges: how adaptivity can play a role in the educational context? How can we use machine learning to provide better learning? How could robots be used to foster adaptive learning for a group of users?\nList of topics  Adaptive mechanisms for robot tutors, personalization and adaptation algorithms for tutoring interactions Design of autonomous systems for tutoring interactions Theories and methods for tutoring (pedagogical and language acquisition) Shared knowledge and knowledge modelling in HRI Human-robot collaborative learning Attachment and learning with a social robot (social and cognitive development) Engagement in educational human-robot interaction Human-robot relationship assessment Designing student models and assessing student’s learning Playful learning with a robot Human-robot creativity Kinesthetic and non-verbal communication in human-robot interaction Impact of embodiment on learning Technical innovation in learning or teaching robots Long term learning interactions, design and methodologies for repeated human-robot encounters Robots for learners with special needs and special abilities Education and re-training for adults Rehabilitation and re-education Privacy and ethical issues in robot tutoring applications  Program          9:00-9:05 Introduction   9:05-9:40 Keynote Tony Belpaeme (30 min +5)   9:40-10:30 Presentations (2 papers, 20 min +5 each)   10:30-11:00 Coffee break   11:00-11:50 Presentations (2 papers, 20 min +5 each)   11:50-12:50 Semi-structured group discussions   12:50-13:00 Conclusion \u0026amp; Wrap up    Selected Papers ","date":1476403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1476403200,"objectID":"d861eee6a59833608588d6689b1b6cf6","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/event/roman2016/","publishdate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/roman2016/","section":"event","summary":"Building Interactions for Classroom Robots","tags":["r4l","RoMan2016","roman"],"title":"R4L @RoMan 2016","type":"event"},{"authors":["Lars Christian\tJensen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470528000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1470528000,"objectID":"aee7f315fa76401ad97458d29eddf1d7","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/publication/roman2016/r4l_ro-man_2016_paper_5/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/roman2016/r4l_ro-man_2016_paper_5/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper I present a microanalytical sequential analysis of people's interactions with a small humanoid robot, in which they play a word formation game together.

It is important to understand the views of the general public as social acceptance will likely play a role in the adoption of such technology. Other literature suggests that teacher attitudes are a strong predictor of technology use in classrooms, so willingness to engage with social robots will influence application in practice. In this paper we present the results of a rigorously-framed survey used to gather the views of both the general public and education professionals towards the use of robots in schools. Overall, we find that the attitude towards social robots in schools is cautious, but potentially accepting. We discuss the reported set of perceived obstacles for the broader adoption of robots in the classroom in this context. Interestingly, concerns about appropriate social skills for the robots dominate over practical and ethical concerns, suggesting that this should remain a focus for child-robot interaction research.","tags":["RoMan2016"],"title":"The Cautious Attitude of Teachers Towards Social Robots in Schools","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul\tBaxter","James\tKennedy","Emily\tAshurst","Tony\tBelpaeme"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470528000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1470528000,"objectID":"cde54c6cd80f338df07c46bc34564d93","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/publication/roman2016/r4l_ro-man_2016_paper_8/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/roman2016/r4l_ro-man_2016_paper_8/","section":"publication","summary":"That “practice makes perfect” is a powerful heuristic for improving performance through repetition. This is widely used in educational context, and as such provides a potentially useful feature for application to child-robot interactions in educational contexts. While this effect may intuitively appear to be present, we here describe data to provide evidence in support of this supposition. Conducting a descriptive analysis of data from a wider study, we specifically examine the effect on child performance of repeating a previously performed collaborative task with a robot if initial performance is low. The results generally indicate a positive effect on performance through repetition, and a number of other correlation effects that highlight the role of individual differences. This outcome provides evidence for the variable utility of repetition between individuals, but also highlights that this is driven by the individual, and can nevertheless result in performance improvements even in the context of peer-peer interactions (i.e. no expert guiding agent present) with sparse feedback.","tags":["RoMan2016"],"title":"The Effect of Repeating Tasks on Performance Levels in Mediated Child-Robot Interactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
