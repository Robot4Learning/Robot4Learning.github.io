This year\u0026rsquo;s half-day workshop follows on previous events in Human-Robot Interaction conferences focusing on efforts to discuss potential benchmarks in design, methodology and evaluation of new robotics systems that help learners. In this 6th edition of the workshop, we will be investigating in particular methods from technologies for education and online learning. Since the past few months, online and remote learning has been put in place in several countries to cope with the health and safety measures due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In this workshop, we aim to discuss strategies to design robotic systems able to provide embodied assistance to the remote learners and to demonstrate long-term learning effects.\nThe workshop is organized as a highly interactive event, in which participants are encouraged to bring case studies taken from their own research and discuss them in groups and with the experts.\nThe workshop will be online (e.g Zoom) and highly interactive. Participants will be asked to prepare the workshop by 1/ answering some questions related to their work and 2/ doing some reading prior to the workshop. The workshop will have two types of session:\n Keynotes: invited senior researchers will share their perspectives and experiences on the field of technologies for education. They will be recorded to allow all participants watch them on-demand. Units: Each unit will aim to look at the participants' work with a certain angle, and will start with a short intro on the topic followed by a group work. Participants will be given tools to help them answer the questions relatively to their planned study/research.  Submission Guidelines We invite participants to report previous or planned research, practice and interest in developing applications in social robots for learning. Researchers from HRI, robotics and educational backgrounds are invited to contribute.\nAuthors are invited to submit a case study on which they will be working during the workshop. To present their case study, we ask them to answer a few questions in line with the units of the workshop.

In both cases, the activity has superficial, visible goals (to find the solution of the equation, to score more points than the other player) covering the deeper, more elusive goal of helping the person learn. In the specific case of learning activities involving social robot, this double-layered structure makes the design of the robot’s behaviour a fascinating challenge: while it is relatively straightforward to design a robot that’s a fierce competitor at a memory game, it is much less clear to envision how it should behave to support its human counterpart in learning. Similarly, the design of the experiment allowing for evaluating the robot’s behaviour, as well as the robot-enhanced learning activity as a whole, becomes at once crucial and non trivial.\nIn this 6th edition of the “Robots for Learning” workshop, international experts in the field will share their knowledge concerning the design of social robot behaviours which support learning, their embedding in a learning activity and the evaluation of their impact through an experiment and the assessment of the person’s learning.

We all learn about different things, at our own pace and method. In classical education, a class of learners is meant to learn a standard course in a pace consistent for the entire class. However, when a group of students are taught the same lessons at the same pace some students may lag in comprehension while some others excel. The concept of adaptive learning originates from the fact that every learner has a unique learning curve and personalized content aligned to her learning curve can improve learning outcomes. Recent technologies have made it possible to capture learner’s data, on the basis of which the system delivers different topics to the learner.\nThe Robots for Learning workshop, in its 5th series, focuses on adaptive learning. Adaptive learning systems are envisioned to maximize learning efficiency, improve learning outcomes, create personalised learning experience, generate analytics for early interventions, increase engagement, and allow for customizability to fit individual needs and preferences. In this workshop, we aim to discuss the approaches and challenges of using robots for learner-centric methods, learning path adaptation, social personalisation, remediation and multimodal techniques. Robots can be able to perceive and monitor learning, and at the same time empathize and give personalized feedback to the learners.\nWith this workshop, we aim at discussing recent advances in empirical and theoretical state-of-the-art research contributions on HRI in educational contexts regarding the following challenges: how adaptivity can play a role in the educational context? How can we use machine learning to provide better learning? How could robots be used to foster adaptive learning for a group of users?\nList of topics  Adaptive mechanisms for robot tutors, personalization and adaptation algorithms for tutoring interactions Design of autonomous systems for tutoring interactions Theories and methods for tutoring (pedagogical and language acquisition) Shared knowledge and knowledge modelling in HRI Human-robot collaborative learning Attachment and learning with a social robot (social and cognitive development) Engagement in educational human-robot interaction Human-robot relationship assessment Designing student models and assessing student’s learning Playful learning with a robot Human-robot creativity Kinesthetic and non-verbal communication in human-robot interaction Impact of embodiment on learning Technical innovation in learning or teaching robots Long term learning interactions, design and methodologies for repeated human-robot encounters Robots for learners with special needs and special abilities Education and re-training for adults Rehabilitation and re-education Privacy and ethical issues in robot tutoring applications  Program 9:00-9:05 Introduction 9:05-9:40 Keynote Tony Belpaeme (30 min +5) 9:40-10:30 Presentations (2 papers, 20 min +5 each) 10:30-11:00 Coffee break 11:00-11:50 Presentations (2 papers, 20 min +5 each) 11:50-12:50 Semi-structured group discussions 12:50-13:00 Conclusion \u0026amp; Wrap up\nSelected Papers    Children’s anthropomorphism of second language robot tutors (Mirjam de Haas, Rianne van den Berghe, Paul Leseman, Emiel Krahmer, Josje Verhagen, Paul Vogt, Bram Willemsen and Jan de Wit)     Storytelling with a social robot (Nicole Goossens, Rian Aarts and Paul Vogt)     Effective robot-human skill transfer via mutual reinforcement learning (Sayanti Roy, Emily Kieson, Charles Abramson and Christopher Crick)   ","date":1571011200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571011200,"objectID":"e90afb9ab78b02d291551e45c71df8d1","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/event/roman2019/","publishdate":"2019-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/roman2019/","section":"event","summary":"Building Interactions for Classroom Robots","tags":["r4l","roman2019","roman"],"title":"R4L @RoMan 2019","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview Since several years, several research groups have investigated the use of robots for learning and teaching. Their work is divided into two main streams that we could call the interaction stream (i-stream) and the building stream (b-stream).The I-stream develops embodied agents able to conduct rich interactions with learners. These are mainly humanoids, part of humanoids or robotised animals that engaged learners in activities (writing, playing, counting, …) and are able to interact about these activities. These robots namely provide verbal and non-verbal hints, encouragement and feedback on several dimensions of the task: performance, cognitive (e.g. level of (mis-)understanding), social (e.g. regulation turn taking in teams), meta-cognitive or emotional. In the b-stream, the learner’s activities is to build the robots capacities. The most popular building activities consist of programming a robot such Thymio, mostly to acquire programming skills. Many other projects in the Makers or FabLab educational initiatives explore the physical construction of the robot either by assembling components from a toolkit such as Lego Mindstorms or by using 3D printing, wiring, etc. These construction activities usually include programming is well, but generally target broader learning goals, mostly STEM skills.\nWhile the I-STREAM addresses research questions that are very close to HRI and ROMAN topics, the work on the b-stream is generally addressed in other venues, creating a divide within those who explore robots in education. This workshop proposes to bring these two streams together because many developments that exist in one stream could also benefit to the other stream. A typical example of these synergies are situations where a humanoid (i-stream) and a learner jointly manipulate a graspable robot (b-stream). This workshop aims to create many more bridges between these two streams.\nList of topics  Learning activities in HRI Adaptive mechanisms for robot tutors Engagement in educational human-robot interaction Gain in learning vs fun in learning with a robot Observational and Kinesthetic learning in human-robot interaction Attachment and learning with a social robot Impact of embodiment on learning Shared knowledge and knowledge modelling in HRI Technical innovation in learning or teaching robots The role of teachers in child-robot interactions Rehabilitation and re-education Human-robot collaborative learning Human-robot creativity Human-robot knowledge sharing Multi-party interaction and group interaction Mixed human, robot and virtual teams  Program 14:00-14:20 Welcome and Introduction\n14:20-14:45 Social Robot as an Awareness Tool to Help Regulate Collaboration in a Project Meeting.

However, this interest is not new: the logo turtle entered schools nearly 40 years ago. Over this period, robots have changed a lot: sequentially or eventually programmable, they also integrate a wide spectrum of sensors and actuators. Hence, new applications in educational contexts can now be envisioned.\nThe Robots for Learning (R4L) workshop is in its 4th series, and the focus of this edition is on inclusive learning. Robots as educational agents have been studied and deployed in various forms – as tools, mediators, tutors, and peers. In this workshop, we aim to discuss the approaches and challenges of developing these educational robots to be more inclusive, helping learners of different ages, backgrounds, genders, and learning abilities. Learners with difficulties often need more attention or personalised training. With this workshop, we aim at discussing recent advances in empirical and theoretical state-of-the-art research contributions on human-robot interaction in educational contexts on the following challenges: How to design robots to adapt to learners abilities? How to build long-term learning with robots? How can robots engage learners in playful learning activities? How can robots assist learners in multimodal learning scenarios?\nWe invite authors to report previous research, practice and interest in developing application in educational robotics.

They are life-sized humanoid robots that can simulate human physiological responses. Commercially available RPSs lack realistic facial and social cues, which limits their ability to engage human learners and immerse them in the simulation. This may cause poor skill transfer, which can result in adverse patient outcomes. We address this by introducing an expressive RPS capable of conveying expressivity far beyond the state of the art, including pain and neurological impairment, and a new shared control system to support clinical educators.

Traditional approaches, such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, try to adapt the content of lessons or the difficulty of tasks to the current estimated knowledge of the student. However, these variations only happen in a limited domain, predefined in advance, and are not able to tackle unexpected variation in a student's behaviours. We argue that robot adaptation needs to go beyond variations in preprogrammed behaviours and that robots should in effect learn online how to become better tutors. A study is currently being carried out to evaluate how human supervision can teach a robot to support child learning during an educational game using one implementation of this approach.","tags":["HRI2018"],"title":"Robots in the classroom: Learning to be a Good Tutor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher\tWallbridge","Séverin\tLemaignan","Emmanuel\tSenft","Charlotte\tEdmunds","Tony\tBelpaeme"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1520380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520380800,"objectID":"94c5500cb55d86f47478c4c5f3ca96df","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/publication/hri2018/r4l_hri2018_paper_2/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hri2018/r4l_hri2018_paper_2/","section":"publication","summary":"Establishing common ground when attempting to disambiguate spatial locations is difficult at the best of times, but is even more challenging between children and robots.

While robots have been popular as a focus for STEM teaching (see Lego Mindstorms or Thymio), the use of robots as tutors is novel. The field of HRI has started reporting on how to make effective robot tutors and how to measure their efficacy. These studies have shown that the potential of robots in educational settings is inarguable: robot can provide educational content tailored to the individual, something which is missing from current educational settings. They also have the potential to enhance learning via kinesthetic interaction, can improve the learner’s self-esteem and can provide empathic feedback. Finally, robots have been shown to engage the learner, to motivate her in the learning task or to enhance collaboration in a group. However, many questions still remain. For instance, what interaction strategies aid learning, and which hamper learning? How can we deal with the current technical limitations of robots? How should effective lessons be developed and implemented on a robot? Answering these and other questions requires a multidisciplinary effort, including contributions from pedagogy, developmental psychology, (computational) linguistics, artificial intelligence and HRI, among others. The aim of this workshop is to engage scholars who aim to gain expertise in education and in robotics (from instructional design to inverse kinematics, ROS to ZPD, Markov to Piaget) into a new interdisciplinary community working on educational robotics. Participants will benefit from hearing from the forefront of field and from discussions on how to move from fundamental research towards the development of market-ready educational robots.\nList of topics  Adaptive mechanisms for robot tutors, personalization and adaptation algorithms for tutoring interactions Theories and methods for tutoring (pedagogical and language acquisition) Engagement in educational human-robot interaction Gain in learning vs fun in learning with a robot Kinesthetic and non-verbal communication in human-robot interaction Attachment and learning with a social robot (social and cognitive development) Impact of embodiment on learning Shared knowledge and knowledge modelling in HRI Technical innovation in learning or teaching robots Rehabilitation and reeducation Long term learning interactions, design and methodologies for repeated human-robot encounters Human-robot collaborative learning Human-robot creativity Design of autonomous systems for tutoring interactions Privacy and ethical issues in robot tutoring applications  Invited Speakers  Pierre Dillenbourg, EPFL, Switzerland  Selected Papers HRI2017.\n","date":1489190400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1489190400,"objectID":"f0ac9ce0109f9887d1ca38f418c78ec6","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/event/hri2017/","publishdate":"2017-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/hri2017/","section":"event","summary":"Inclusive Learning","tags":["r4l","hri2017","hri"],"title":"R4L @HRI 2017","type":"event"},{"authors":["Johanna\tHemminki","Anne\tErkinheimo-Kyllönen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488844800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488844800,"objectID":"d33910bde3821cf6d7b03aac7e41b992","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/publication/hri2017/r4l_hri_2017_paper_5/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hri2017/r4l_hri_2017_paper_5/","section":"publication","summary":"We are looking for a way to make use of Nao robot in learning Finnish as a L2.

We approach the topic with the means of Conversation Analysis (CA). The target group are adult students studying at the Helsinki Skill Center aiming to work at the area of health care.\nOur questions are:\n1) Can a humanoid robot reduce a fear of making mistakes and that way promote speaking? Is it easier to ask help from a robot? 2) Can robots support self-paced and self-guided learning? 3) How robots can deal with students’ feelings and what kind of affective qualities does robot-assisted teaching have?\nAccording to our material in human-tutored session students didn’t take independent contact, but the teacher made the decision to ask help for the students. In robot-tutored session the students touched the hand of a robot independently. However, it is too early to draw general conclusions about if a robot is more approachable than a human. There was more laughter in the robot-assisted learning situations. The robot may have brought more joy and easiness to the learning situation and that way promote learning. Working with a robot in the teaching situation the studied language material was more limited and the robot repeated the words more than those with the human language tutor.","tags":["HRI2017"],"title":"A Humanoid Robot as a Language Tutor","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raul\tParadeda","Maria José","Carlos\tMartinho","João\tDias\tj","Ana\tPaiva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488844800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488844800,"objectID":"f7cca2ced9a6242a939e8eab201eefff","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/publication/hri2017/r4l_hri_2017_paper_6/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hri2017/r4l_hri_2017_paper_6/","section":"publication","summary":"Scientific research has proven that Storytelling scenarios are a powerful form of learning, knowledge sharing and persuasion. The Storytelling technique is widely applied because stories have a great power to influence the person in an emotional way and can inspire people to change their behaviour in the desired direction. Nowadays, the social robotics area, specifically assistive robotics, has been presenting research that uses storytelling to try to persuade the participant to perform a specific task or follow instructions. In the case of social robotics applied to education, it is important to guide the student through paths that allow improving the learning rate. In this sense, the persuasion made by this kind of non-live agent should be subtle and preferably without noticing (the person does not perceive that she/he is being persuaded).

The high degree of uncanny feeling initially produced by The Polar Express was verified by means of a questionnaire and discussion in the class performed just after the first scene of the movie was stopped. When some weeks after the entire movies was shown to the pupils, this uncanny feeling appears to be weaker and when finally pupils were tested on their memories concerning both movies, answers got in The Polar Express case did not appear to be less relevant than those got for Dark Crystal. The reported experiment suggests that highly human-like faces do not prevent to transmit information to be learned by pupils, which tends to indicate that faces of future teaching robots could take human form.","tags":["HRI2017"],"title":"Has Uncanny Valley Feeling an Impact on Learning: A preliminary Experiment performed in a French Elementary School","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pouyan\tZiafati","Francisco J\tRodríguez Lera","Andreia\tPinto Costa","Aida\tNazarikhorram","Leon\tVan Der Torre"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488844800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488844800,"objectID":"3aa3aa1118989a2264f829ecbde0edb8","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/publication/hri2017/r4l_hri_2017_paper_9/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hri2017/r4l_hri_2017_paper_9/","section":"publication","summary":"For robot tutors, autonomy and personalizations are important factors in order to engage users as well as to personalize the content and interaction according to the needs of individuals. This paper presents the Programming Cognitive Robot (ProCRob) software architecture to target personalized social robotics in two complementary ways. ProCRob supports the development and personalization of social robot applications by teachers and therapists without computer programming background. It also supports the development of autonomous robots which can adapt according to the human-robot interaction context. ProCRob is based on our previous research on autonomous robotics and has been developed since 2015 by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers from the fields of AI, Robotics and Psychology as well as artists and designers at the University of Luxembourg. ProCRob is currently being used and further developed for therapy of children with autism, and for encouraging rehabilitation activities in patients with post-stroke.

The authors have been implementing two approaches to designing robot/child interaction activities for ESL children : one-on-one learning in play and small-group learning in play. In the former approach, a child interacted with an embodied robot individually to develop vocabulary and early literacy skills. Based on our study of theories of learning and child development, we sought to create engaging robot-based learning, where the child played with the robot to practice the skills. Through our experience, it was clear that pedagogically solid design and iterative refinement led to sustainable robot/child interaction. The latter approach is currently being explored in our on-going research. Acknowledging that language learning and cultural understanding are inseparable, we examine the role of a robot as a cultural broker that mediates collaborative learning and play among children from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds. During the workshop, we will discuss our motivation toward this approach and pedagogical grounding for the approach, and the progress that has been made in the design of robot-mediated","tags":["HRI2017"],"title":"Robot-Based Learning Design for Young Children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chihiro\tNishimoto","Shunsuke\tAkashiba","Takeshi\tMorita","Takahira\tYamaguch"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488844800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488844800,"objectID":"882d54114ba7f80d6c818e2fa5a8da41","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/publication/hri2017/r4l_hri_2017_paper_4/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hri2017/r4l_hri_2017_paper_4/","section":"publication","summary":"PRINTEPS (Practical INTEligent aPplicationS) is a total intelligent application development platform that integrates 5 types of sub systems (knowledge-based reasoning, speech dialog, image sensing, manipulation and machine learning).

Socially Assistive Robotics (SAR) is an efficient tool for educational and health-care purposes. In this work, we present our SAR system for personalized and adaptive cognitive training. More specifically, we present the sequence learning task that provides measures for executive function assessment, which may indicate learning or even behavior disabilities in children. This work outlines the designing and evaluation process of such a system, including data collection and analysis. The long-term goal of this research is to develop interactive machine learning methods towards the design of an adaptive SAR system that provides a personalized training session by adjusting the session parameters and the robot's behavior to maximize user engagement and performance.","tags":["HRI2017"],"title":"Towards Designing a Socially Assistive Robot for Adaptive and Personalized Cognitive Training","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview Learning occurs throughout our entire life. We all learn about different things, at our own pace and method. In classical education, a class of learners is meant to learn a standard course in a pace consistent for the entire class. However, when a group of students are taught the same lessons at the same pace some students may lag in comprehension while some others excel. The concept of adaptive learning originates from the fact that every learner has a unique learning curve and personalized content aligned to her learning curve can improve learning outcomes. Recent technologies have made it possible to capture learner’s data, on the basis of which the system delivers different topics to the learner.\nThe Robots for Learning workshop, in its 5th series, focuses on adaptive learning. Adaptive learning systems are envisioned to maximize learning efficiency, improve learning outcomes, create personalised learning experience, generate analytics for early interventions, increase engagement, and allow for customizability to fit individual needs and preferences. In this workshop, we aim to discuss the approaches and challenges of using robots for learner-centric methods, learning path adaptation, social personalisation, remediation and multimodal techniques. Robots can be able to perceive and monitor learning, and at the same time empathize and give personalized feedback to the learners.\nWith this workshop, we aim at discussing recent advances in empirical and theoretical state-of-the-art research contributions on HRI in educational contexts regarding the following challenges: how adaptivity can play a role in the educational context? How can we use machine learning to provide better learning? How could robots be used to foster adaptive learning for a group of users?\nList of topics  Adaptive mechanisms for robot tutors, personalization and adaptation algorithms for tutoring interactions Design of autonomous systems for tutoring interactions Theories and methods for tutoring (pedagogical and language acquisition) Shared knowledge and knowledge modelling in HRI Human-robot collaborative learning Attachment and learning with a social robot (social and cognitive development) Engagement in educational human-robot interaction Human-robot relationship assessment Designing student models and assessing student’s learning Playful learning with a robot Human-robot creativity Kinesthetic and non-verbal communication in human-robot interaction Impact of embodiment on learning Technical innovation in learning or teaching robots Long term learning interactions, design and methodologies for repeated human-robot encounters Robots for learners with special needs and special abilities Education and re-training for adults Rehabilitation and re-education Privacy and ethical issues in robot tutoring applications  Program          9:00-9:05 Introduction   9:05-9:40 Keynote Tony Belpaeme (30 min +5)   9:40-10:30 Presentations (2 papers, 20 min +5 each)   10:30-11:00 Coffee break   11:00-11:50 Presentations (2 papers, 20 min +5 each)   11:50-12:50 Semi-structured group discussions   12:50-13:00 Conclusion \u0026amp; Wrap up    Selected Papers ","date":1476403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1476403200,"objectID":"d861eee6a59833608588d6689b1b6cf6","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/event/roman2016/","publishdate":"2016-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/roman2016/","section":"event","summary":"Building Interactions for Classroom Robots","tags":["r4l","RoMan2016","roman"],"title":"R4L @RoMan 2016","type":"event"},{"authors":["Lars Christian\tJensen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470528000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1470528000,"objectID":"aee7f315fa76401ad97458d29eddf1d7","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/publication/roman2016/r4l_ro-man_2016_paper_5/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/roman2016/r4l_ro-man_2016_paper_5/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper I present a microanalytical sequential analysis of people's interactions with a small humanoid robot, in which they play a word formation game together.

The goal of the game is to exit the maze - the child is asked by the robot to make it walk through the maze to its exit. The child needs to learn the basics of programming through the game via drag-and-drop instructions on the tablet screen. This paper presents an HRI study which aims to investigate which role of the robot (peer vs. teacher) would result in more learning gains in this particular application. The findings suggest that children complete the task much quicker with the peer robot while a teacher robot is shown to be more effective for learning.","tags":["RoMan2016"],"title":"Evaluating Peer Versus Teacher Robot within Educational Scenario of Learning Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Igor Verner","Alex Polishuk","Niv Krayner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470528000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1470528000,"objectID":"5f6c3d9ae503c581a9a310451e80b771","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/publication/roman2016/r4l_ro-man_2016_paper_1/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/roman2016/r4l_ro-man_2016_paper_1/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper considers a science lesson given through mediation of the humanoid RoboThespian to groups of school students (grades 5-7) at the science museum MadaTech.

It is important to understand the views of the general public as social acceptance will likely play a role in the adoption of such technology. Other literature suggests that teacher attitudes are a strong predictor of technology use in classrooms, so willingness to engage with social robots will influence application in practice. In this paper we present the results of a rigorously-framed survey used to gather the views of both the general public and education professionals towards the use of robots in schools. Overall, we find that the attitude towards social robots in schools is cautious, but potentially accepting. We discuss the reported set of perceived obstacles for the broader adoption of robots in the classroom in this context. Interestingly, concerns about appropriate social skills for the robots dominate over practical and ethical concerns, suggesting that this should remain a focus for child-robot interaction research.","tags":["RoMan2016"],"title":"The Cautious Attitude of Teachers Towards Social Robots in Schools","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul\tBaxter","James\tKennedy","Emily\tAshurst","Tony\tBelpaeme"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470528000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1470528000,"objectID":"cde54c6cd80f338df07c46bc34564d93","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/publication/roman2016/r4l_ro-man_2016_paper_8/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/roman2016/r4l_ro-man_2016_paper_8/","section":"publication","summary":"That “practice makes perfect” is a powerful heuristic for improving performance through repetition. This is widely used in educational context, and as such provides a potentially useful feature for application to child-robot interactions in educational contexts. While this effect may intuitively appear to be present, we here describe data to provide evidence in support of this supposition. Conducting a descriptive analysis of data from a wider study, we specifically examine the effect on child performance of repeating a previously performed collaborative task with a robot if initial performance is low. The results generally indicate a positive effect on performance through repetition, and a number of other correlation effects that highlight the role of individual differences. This outcome provides evidence for the variable utility of repetition between individuals, but also highlights that this is driven by the individual, and can nevertheless result in performance improvements even in the context of peer-peer interactions (i.e. no expert guiding agent present) with sparse feedback.","tags":["RoMan2016"],"title":"The Effect of Repeating Tasks on Performance Levels in Mediated Child-Robot Interactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://Robot4Learning.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
